## üí° Tips

1. **Transaction History**: After any operation, check transaction history to see logged transactions
2. **Receipt Printing**: Every successful transaction prints a receipt automatically
3. **Failed Transactions**: Even failed operations are logged - check history to see them
4. **Multiple Accounts**: Customers with multiple accounts will be prompted to select one
5. **Account Types**: Notice different behaviors:
   - Savings: Can't go below $500
   - Checking: Can go negative up to $1000

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "Class not found" error
- **Solution**: Make sure you're in the correct directory and have compiled all files

**Problem**: Account is blocked
- **Solution**: Use admin portal to unblock the customer

**Problem**: Transfer fails
- **Solution**: Check account numbers, ensure sufficient funds, verify destination account exists

## üìù What to Observe

1. **Security**: 3 failed login attempts ‚Üí account blocks
2. **Business Rules**: 
   - Savings minimum balance enforcement
   - Checking overdraft limits
3. **Transaction Logging**: All operations logged with status
4. **Polymorphism**: Same operations work differently for Savings vs Checking
5. **Data Structures**: Fast lookups for customers and accounts

## üéì Learning Points

- **OOP**: Inheritance (SavingsAccount extends BankAccount)
- **Polymorphism**: Different withdraw() behavior per account type
- **Data Structures**: HashMap for O(1) lookups, ArrayList for ordered collections
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions with meaningful messages
- **Design Patterns**: Repository (Bank), Facade (Bank interface)
